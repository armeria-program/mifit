MIFit uses a custom file format called a 'session file'. Until now, the format
of these files has been undocumented. This document contains some of the
specifics of the file format (as well as they can be surmised from the current
code and examples). This document is not complete.

The file extension recognized for session files is .mlw.

Session files can contain model information, viewpoint information, some map
information, and annotations.

Session files can contain script commands which are documented in Appendix A
of the MIFit Manual.

Session files can be XML formatted. The XML format is how session files are
currently created from MIFit, but MIExpert creates plain text session files
and older versions of MIFit may have created other formats.

MIFit code recognizes XML formatted session files in two ways. The function
MIGLWidget::IsXMLMolecule looks for the '<?xml' tag and for the '<Molecule' tag
using a simple substring search. The function MIGLWidget::IsXMLDocument looks
for '<?xml' and '<wxFitDocument' in a similar manner. 

XML session files are read using the MoleculeHandler which derives from a
SAX parser interface in the Xerces library. Only MIGLWidget::LoadXMLMolecule
uses this class; however, the XML files are read in processed by other parts
of the code in non-XML ways.

XML tags:

This is a overview of the XML tags. It is missing information regarding what
the tags represent, the attributes they contain, and other schema information.
These tags were found from the session file output code. Some of these tags
may not be processed upon reading. Also, other additional tags may be
recognized during reading. Analysis the input code is yet to be done.

XML session files are written using the XMLArchive class and member functions
of the classes Annotation, Molecule, MIGLWidget.
