Information on using pentamers with xfit.

The environment variable XFITPENTDIR must be set to
the directory this readme file is in.  
Example:
setenv XFITPENTDIR /asd/prog/XtalView/pdbvec

This activates
the pentamer menu item in the model.insert menu (i.e
it goes from gray to black).  You can then pull up the
pentamer menu by sliding the mouse to the right.
Select in the residue list the first residue of a sequence
of 5 to make it the focus residue.  When you then select
insert.pentamers.find_best_pentamer then the software
searches a list of CA-CA vectors and finds the best match.
This pentamer is pulled out of the appropiate pdb file and
loaded as the next model in xfit.  You can then choose 
replace_middle_3 and replace the middle 3 residues of the
pentamer into the active model.  The ends are discarded
because there are no constraints on the first and last 
peptide bonds.   At this point you can then skip ahead
2 residues and repeat the process to grow the chain longer.
The pentamer will have the sequence of the original pdb
file. 

The side chains then need to be fixed.  Select the residue to
be changed.  Then change the amino acid type using the pull-down
menu or by hand-editing.  (Note: a dictionary file needs to be
loaded first - you can use xfit/dict.pdb or any other pdb format
file that contains an instance of the residue.) The residue
is then torsioned into place using the fitting commands.

Hint: use a MRK residue (in xfit/dict.pdb) which is a single
CA atom to mark the C alpha positions.  The residues must be 
in the correct order in the model list.

To change the pentamer database:
the command file $XFITPENTDIR/genlist is used to generate
the pentamer vectors.  You can add or delete pdb files to
this list and then rerun genlist to change the pentamer
database.  I have tried to supply a balanced list of structures
of high quality. Feel free to add/delete as you wish.
