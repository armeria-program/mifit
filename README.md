## News

### March 2015

Project moved to GitHub because Google Code is shutting down.

### October 2010
MIFit 2010.10 is available for download. See [Releases](https://github.com/mifit/mifit/releases).
You may build MIFit yourself from the source distribution (see the enclosed README.txt), or
download the Windows installer or Linux binaries archive.

MIExpert is now distributed as a separate package. Although it can be used separately, MIExpert
is designed to be used with MIFit. To use MIExpert with MIFit, run MIFit and open the
MIExpert/setupJobMenu.py file. The setupJobMenu.py script will configure the Job menu in MIFit.
Note: MIExpert scripts require [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro)
in order to run from MIFit.
